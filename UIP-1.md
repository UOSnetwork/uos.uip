UÂ°OS Block Explorer
-------------------

We need a block explorer published separately from u.community.

The proposed url is https://uos.network/monitor

Must-have features:

* RAM Calculator
* Current producer
* Current block
* Current TPS / Max TPS
* List of current active and backup BPs with a vote link taking to u.communitu/governance 

Impact
-------

A block explorer is a user-friendly way to look into the network. It's pretty much a must-have for project transparency and visibility.
